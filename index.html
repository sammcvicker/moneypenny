    <meta name="description" content="Madeline Moneypenny is a Brooklyn-based vocalist, composer, and mixing engineer. She is a graduate of the Bard College Jazz Performance and Electronic Music Program, with a minor in Gender and Sexuality Studies. Her original work explores the voice as an instrument, guided by a curiosity about female and non-male experiences in interpersonal relationships and music at large. Moneypenny is inspired by cycles of growth, stagnation, self-discovery, and sexual agency. She premiered her first solo album Like a Dream in early 2022 to warm reviews. Her sound ranges from velvet smooth new-wave R&B to danceable jazz-rock fusion." />
